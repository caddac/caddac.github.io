                <p>The Stagecoach 400 is a challenging bikepacking route that takes riders through some of Southern
                    California's most beautiful and demanding terrain. This year's edition proved to be a true test of
                    endurance, strategy, and mental fortitude.</p>

                <h2>Day 1: The Long Haul</h2>
                <p>The race started strong with a great ride to Warner Springs. However, the Nature Preserve section
                    nearly got the best of me - a combination of calorie management and hike-a-bike (HAB) sections
                    helped me push through. Julian was a crucial resupply point, though in retrospect, I should have
                    fueled up more with hot food there.</p>

                <p>The temperature dropped significantly from Julian to the lake, making for a chilly ride. The single
                    track along the highway was a welcome change of pace, with a much-needed water stop at Oakanita
                    Campground. Descanso provided another opportunity for hot food, though the descent into Alpine was
                    challenging with cold and foggy conditions.</p>

                <p>The truck trail and single track sections leading to Sycuan were particularly tough, as I found
                    myself severely underfueled at the station. A burger and caffeine boost helped, but saddle sores
                    were becoming a serious concern. The final push through Sweetwater Reserve to the hotel was a relief
                    after a long first day.</p>

                <h2>Day 2: The Mental Battle</h2>
                <p>Day 2 started with some much-needed recovery - Aquaphor for the saddle sores and a proper bed made a
                    world of difference. The slow roll through San Diego was a nice change of pace, and Del Mar's
                    McDonald's proved to be a surprisingly effective refueling stop.</p>

                <p>The road up to the Saddleback trailhead was a true test of mental fortitude - the hike-a-bike
                    sections were absolutely brutal. A chance encounter with Thomas on these roads led to a crucial
                    freehub check on Engineers. The descent on Oriflamme was both mind-blowing and challenging, with
                    cold conditions adding to the difficulty.</p>

                <h2>Day 3: The Final Push</h2>
                <p>The desert section on the final day was particularly challenging, with deep sand and washboard roads
                    making progress difficult. The highway out of the desert was a battle against both headwinds and
                    heat. The Iron Door stop was a welcome respite, with a brat and cold drinks providing much-needed
                    energy.</p>

                <p>The headwind from Iron Door to Borrego Springs was relentless, forcing a 20-minute nap in the shade
                    of a sign. After a burrito in Borrego, I made the strategic decision to lighten my load, ditching
                    some extra food to make room for essential items like Red Bull.</p>

                <p>The climb out was challenging, with route finding becoming increasingly difficult in the dark. The
                    section before the willows was particularly nerve-wracking, but I managed to navigate through
                    successfully. The final push to Anza and the subsequent road sections felt endless, though the map
                    showed I was actually making good progress.</p>

                <p>The final climb and descent were a blur of exhaustion and determination. After finishing, a shower
                    and breakfast at Grandma's diner were well-earned rewards, though I was so spent that I managed to
                    sleep through the winding drive down from Idyllwild.</p>

                <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>This year's Stagecoach 400 taught me several valuable lessons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hot food is crucial for maintaining energy levels</li>
                    <li>Proper load management is essential - I definitely overbiked in several sections</li>
                    <li>Strategic rest stops and refueling can make or break a long-distance effort</li>
                    <li>Mental preparation is just as important as physical preparation</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Despite the challenges, the Stagecoach 400 remains one of the most rewarding bikepacking routes in
                    Southern California, offering a perfect mix of beautiful scenery, challenging terrain, and personal
                    growth opportunities.</p>
