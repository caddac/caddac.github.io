                <p>The morning air was crisp, hovering around 30 degrees as we gathered at the start line in Flagstaff.
                    I had over-prepared for the cold, donning a rain jacket and pogies, not realizing that the brutal
                    climb up Elden would soon have me sweating. That climb would set the tone for the day - I pushed too
                    hard, setting personal heart rate records from 5 seconds all the way up to 90 minutes. In
                    hindsight, I should have taken a moment at the top to refuel, but the excitement of the descent
                    pulled me forward.</p>

                <p>The single track through Hobbit Forest was a highlight, with Wyatt capturing some incredible photos
                    of the journey. The trail was challenging but fun, a perfect mix of technical features and flow.
                    However, my first major mistake came at Schultz Tank. In my eagerness to follow my Garmin, I failed
                    to properly check the route and ended up three miles out on the Northern Loop. The return slog back
                    up the hill was a humbling experience, made more so when a friendly rider asked, "Are you lost?" I
                    pondered that question - was I really lost if I knew exactly how far off course I'd gone?</p>

                <p>The miles to Lake Mary Store were uneventful, mostly spent catching up to riders who had passed me
                    during my detour. I timed my water perfectly, running dry just 100 yards from the store. A quick
                    stop for a gallon of water and a liter of cola, and I was back on the trail, chasing after Rei Rey
                    who had just left the store.</p>

                <p>The gravel roads rolled by, but I wasn't eating enough. When I reached the Schnebly Hill overlook,
                    the view was so stunning that I had to stop for photos.</p>

                <div class="photo-gallery">
                    <div class="photo-item">
                        <img src="pinyons_pines_photos/Schnebly Overlook 1.jpg" alt="Schnebly Hill Overlook">

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>The descent down Schnebly Hill Road was chunky and fast, and I kept a keen eye out for the Munds
                    Wagon Trail turnoff. The trail itself was incredibly technical, but my Epic Evo handled it
                    beautifully, making me grateful for the full suspension as I bounced through the chunky terrain.</p>

                <p>Darkness had fallen by the time I reached the bottom, and the sight of Filiberto's was a welcome one.
                    Rei Rey and a couple other riders were there, taking a break. I made another tactical error here,
                    ordering two massive carne asada burritos that weighed about 1.5 pounds each. I managed only a few
                    bites before filling up water at the gas station and pushing on, despite clearly needing a longer
                    rest.</p>

                <p>The night riding through single track was challenging, and I was soon passed by the riders from
                    Filiberto's. My energy was waning, and I found myself wondering how much further I could go. I
                    passed a few riders catching naps along the gravel sections before reaching Trail 12, the last water
                    stop before Casner Mountain.</p>

                <p>This is where things really started to unravel. Instead of stopping to rest and refuel properly, I
                    pushed on up Casner.</p>

                <div class="photo-gallery">
                    <div class="photo-item">

                <p>My heart rate at just 120 bpm, would leave me breathing hard. I was so deep in a nutritional hole
                    that I couldn't even recognize the need for food and rest. I thought only about trying to push
                    chasing after my goals. Finally, I realized I needed to sleep. After about 90 minutes of sleep on
                    the mountain, I tried to continue, but my body was done. The realization that I had chosent to
                    scratch was a humbling moment.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Looking back, there were many lessons learned. The bike performed flawlessly, handling everything
                    from loaded touring to technical single track with ease. The pogies were more than sufficient for
                    the cold, making the winter gloves unnecessary. But the biggest takeaway was the importance of
                    proper nutrition, rest and good goal setting. Sometimes the strongest move is knowing when to stop,
                    regroup, and live to fight another day.</p>

                <p>While the race didn't end as planned, the experience was invaluable. The views were spectacular, the
                    trails were challenging, and the community was supportive. I'll be back, better prepared and wiser
                    for the experience.</p>
