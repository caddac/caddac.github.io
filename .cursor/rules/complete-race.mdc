### Task 

Move an "upcoming race" to "past results"

### Requirements

1. ALWAYS prioritize the most recent race that has occurred (i.e., the race with the most recent date that is now in the past)
2. Identify a race in the "upcoming races" section that has already occurred (i.e., its date is in the past)
3. Move the existing race item to the "past results" section
4. Race results should be ordered, most recent result at the top
5. All race results should have:
   * Finish status, either time to finish or some other status (like scratched)
   * A link to the race results (ask for this)
   * A link to a blog post, which goes in the "blog" directory. Create this page.

### Process
1. First, scan the "upcoming races" section and identify the race with the most recent date
2. If that race's date is in the past, that is the race to move
3. If that race's date is in the future, look for the next most recent race
4. Once the correct race is identified, proceed with moving it to past results
